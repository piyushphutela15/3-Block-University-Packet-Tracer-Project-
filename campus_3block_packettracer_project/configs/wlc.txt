! Wireless LAN Controller - high-level notes for Packet Tracer / real WLC
! (Exact commands depend on WLC model; Packet Tracer GUI often used)

! Management interface (on management VLAN 10) - set via GUI or CLI
! Example settings (pseudo-CLI):
! Management IP: 10.10.10.100
! Default GW: 10.10.10.1
! SSIDs:
! - Uni-Student -> VLAN 50 (WPA2-PSK or 802.1X)
! - Uni-Staff -> VLAN 30 (WPA2-Enterprise)
! - Uni-Guest -> VLAN 20 (Captive portal / separate VLAN)

! If using controller in Packet Tracer, use the GUI to map SSIDs to VLANs and set security.
